<h1>Sān Spel</h1>

<p>Sān Spel is a mobile app that helps users see how much easier
reading, writing, and learning English would be if we English revised
spelling rules. Sān Spel allows a user to enter English text in the
currently accepted spelling and to respell that text with rules that are
much simpler and more consistent than currently accepted rules.</p>

<p>Consider the above paragraph as it was respelled by the Sān Spel
app:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>You can install Sān Spel from the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>The Sān Spel mobile app is produced by the Spelling Sanity
organization, and the spelling rules used by Sān Spel were developed by
the Spelling Sanity organization. However, Spelling Sanity hopes to
engage all interested individuals to help define spelling rules.</p>

<p>The respelled text above uses accent marks above the vowels to
indicate long and short vowel sounds. If people find the accent marks
too difficult to read or write, we could instead use double vowels for
long vowel sounds as shown here:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Another alternative is to simply respell the 200 most inconsistently
spelled words. Perhaps this would include the following words (in no
particular order):</p>
<ul>
    <li>comb</li>
    <li>laugh</li>
    <li>right</li>
    <li>have</li>
    <li>of</li>
    <li>thorough</li>
    <li>bough</li>
    <li>acre</li>
    <li>sign</li>
    <li>talk</li>
